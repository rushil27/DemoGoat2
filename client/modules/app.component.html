App component
==================================================================
** The app component in our implementation has two main purposes
** 1) render all components which will stay persistent on the site
**    these components are considered view independent and are found
**    in the core module which is located at: root/client/modules/core/components folder
** 2) initialize the main router for the webpage.
**    <router-outlet> is where all the router views will render.
